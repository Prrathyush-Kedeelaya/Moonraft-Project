# Challenging Fake Image Detection using GAN Models
## Project objective
To determine whether a picture has undergone fabrication or manipulation, such as splicing, combine the application of error-level analysis (ELA) and deep learning.

## Methods
1. Error-level analysis
2. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)

## Result
1. Convergence: Epoch 30
2. Best accuracy: 98.13% (epoch 30)
